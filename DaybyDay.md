# login-signup
Simple login and signup interface for multiple users and admins

Day 1:
I set up the general display for the interface using code from piglatin translator project. The user is promted with a choice bar betwen login and signup. For the login choice the frame has username and password textfields. For teh signup choice the frame has create username, create password, and confirm password textfields.
